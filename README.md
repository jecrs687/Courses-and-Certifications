# Here's the place where I had improved myself with great skills
To improve me and my knowledge as well, I decided to start courses on online platforms during the covid pandemic.
- [Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach by university of washington](#machine).
- [Front-End With React by Hong Kong University](#React)
## <a name="machine">Machine Learning Foundations</a>
I did this course on coursera platform. It was a great course to start in the machine learning world. 
if you would to check the certificate [link](https://coursera.org/share/09b4af1cf4bc575eb15e147ffb18cddd)
Furthermore, [here's](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning) the link for the course.
Using the library turiCreative I did some experiments on the jupyter python notebook

## <a name="React">Front-End With React by Hong Kong University</a>
I did this course on coursera platform. It was a great course to become in the next level with react.
[Here's](https://www.coursera.org/learn/front-end-react) the link for the course. 
[Here's](https://jecrs687.github.io/Courses-and-Certifications/Confusion) the preview of the site.
>That preview doesn't have a connection with the server, but in the final project, I did it. Unfortunately, I can't share it, because It needs a server running.

Week 1 - Introduction to React
</summary>
I started the development of a react application, it name is ConFusion, it is something like a menu for a restaurant with who has that name. 
I learned about components (I already did know it, but the course was deeper than my knowledge). Also, we create a page using bootstrap, react-scrap, font-awesome and other technologies

<summary>
Week 2 - React Router and Single Page Applications
</summary>
Here I used the react-router-dom to implement a single page application

Week 3 - React Forms, Flow Architecture and Introduction to Redux
  </summary>
ere we created in two ways forms. Firstly, we used only react and, in a second way, we used a library to interact directly with redux. </details><details>
<summary>
Week 4 - More Redux and Client-Server Communication
</summary>
Using the package json-server I put to run my server to provide information to the website, also, the server provided, as well, pictures too.
