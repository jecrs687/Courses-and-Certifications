## <a name="machine">Machine Learning Foundations</a>
I did this course on coursera platform. It was a great course to start in the machine learning world. 
if you would to check the certificate [link](https://coursera.org/share/09b4af1cf4bc575eb15e147ffb18cddd)
Furthermore, [here's](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning) the link for the course.
Using the library turiCreative I did some experiments on the jupyter python notebook
<details>
<summary>Week 1 - Introduction</summary>
On the first week the lessons focus was only in the most commons commands using turicreative
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Week 2 - Regression: Predicting House Prices
</summary>
Here I did my first experiment using machine learning. I predicted houses prices based on location, the number of restrooms, square meters, rooms and other characteristics of houses. 
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Week 3 - Classification: Analyzing Sentiment
</summary>
Creating a rating of sentiment placed on products comments and understanding what will be the rating of a person based on the comment which he wrote. 
</details><details>
<summary>
Week 4 - Clustering and Similarity: Retrieving Documents
</summary>
Here I clustered documents based on TF-IDF. And I clustered more than 2 thousands documents about people on Wikipedia 
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Week 5 - Recommending Products
</summary>
Based on the purchases of a costumer, I tried predict the products interesting for that person.
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Week 6 - Deep Learning: Searching for Images
</summary>
Using a dataset with 5 thousand images, I identified three types of images (with cats, with birds, with cars) and got information about those automatically after training a neural network using the principles of deep learning.

## <a name="React">Front-End With React by Hong Kong University</a>
I did this course on coursera platform. It was a great course to become in the next level with react.
[Here's](https://www.coursera.org/learn/front-end-react) the link for the course. 
[Here's](https://jecrs687.github.io/Courses-and-Certifications/Confusion) the preview of the site.
>That preview doesn't have a connection with the server, but in the final project, I did it. Unfortunately, I can't share it, because It needs a server running.
<details>
<summary>
Week 1 - Introduction to React
</summary>
I started the development of a react application, it name is ConFusion, it is something like a menu for a restaurant with who has that name. 
I learned about components (I already did know it, but the course was deeper than my knowledge). Also, we create a page using bootstrap, react-scrap, font-awesome and other technologies
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Week 2 - React Router and Single Page Applications
</summary>
Here I used the react-router-dom to implement a single page application
</details>
<details>
<summary>
Week 3 - React Forms, Flow Architecture and Introduction to Redux
  </summary>
ere we created in two ways forms. Firstly, we used only react and, in a second way, we used a library to interact directly with redux. </details><details>
<summary>
Week 4 - More Redux and Client-Server Communication
</summary>
Using the package json-server I put to run my server to provide information to the website, also, the server provided, as well, pictures too.
